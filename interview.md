**What Is DevOps?**

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

**What is Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

**What is EC2 and benifits**

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. By providing a web service through which developers can create virtual machines, called Amazon EC2 instances, containing any software desired.

**What is S3 and benifits**

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, backup and restore for DRS, archive and big data analytics.

**What is 2-Tier Architecture**

A 2-tier architecture is a client-server architecture in which the application is divided into two logical tiers: the presentation tier and the data tier. The presentation tier is the user interface, which is the part of the application that the user interacts with. The data tier is the part of the application that stores and retrieves data.

Benefits of 2-Tier Architecture, 2-Tier Architecture is a simple architecture that is easy to understand and implement.
It is also easy to maintain and scale

**How do you secure instance on AWS**

You can secure your instance by using security groups. Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.

**What is Autoscaling and Load Balancing**

Autoscaling is a feature of AWS that allows you to automatically scale your EC2 instances up or down based on a set of rules. for example, you can set up a rule that will automatically scale your instances up when the CPU utilization of your instances reaches 70% for 5 minutes.

Load balancing is a feature of AWS that allows you to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. This is useful if you have multiple instances running the same application and you want to distribute the traffic across all of them.
